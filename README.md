# Phishing Email Simulation

This project demonstrates a phishing email attack simulation using the **Social Engineering Toolkit (SET)** in Kali Linux.  
The goal was to understand phishing indicators and analyze how attackers craft deceptive emails.  

## Objective
- To simulate real-world phishing scenarios.  
- To study how email payloads and malicious links are delivered.  
- To identify detection points and defense mechanisms.  

## Tools Used
- Kali Linux  
- Social Engineering Toolkit (SET)  
- Email client for testing  

## Steps Performed
1. Configured SET for email template-based phishing attack.  
2. Crafted a phishing email with a spoofed sender and malicious link.  
3. Sent test emails within a lab environment.  
4. Observed user interaction and captured results.  
5. Documented phishing indicators such as:
   - Suspicious sender address  
   - Unexpected attachments  
   - Malicious redirect links  

## Outcome
- Successfully simulated phishing emails in a controlled environment.  
- Identified multiple phishing red flags (headers, links, formatting).  
- Gained insights into how security tools can block or flag such attempts.
